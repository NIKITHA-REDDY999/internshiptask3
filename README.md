Excited to share my third internship task where I worked with SQLite to analyze e-commerce data! Here's a quick overview of what I accomplished:

ðŸ”¹ Average Items per Order: Calculated the average number of items in each order (1.14 items/order)
ðŸ”¹ Customer Order Analysis: Identified top customers by order volume and their locations (mostly SÃ£o Paulo)
ðŸ”¹ Payment Insights: Analyzed payment types and values, filtering orders above average payment value
ðŸ”¹ Geographic Trends: Discovered order distribution by state (SP leads with 41,746 orders)

This task helped me strengthen my SQL skills in:
âœ… Writing complex queries with JOINs and subqueries
âœ… Using aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG)
âœ… Analyzing real-world e-commerce datasets

Special thanks to elevate labs for this valuable learning opportunity!

 Order Item Analysis
- Calculated average items per order (1.14)
```sql
SELECT AVG(item_count) AS avg_items
FROM (
    SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS item_count 
    FROM order_item 
    GROUP BY order_id
)
2. Customer Insights
Identified top customers by order volume

Geographic distribution of orders (SP state dominates with 41,746 orders)

3. Payment Analysis
Filtered orders with above-average payment values

Examined payment type distribution

Results
The analysis revealed:
Most customers are concentrated in SÃ£o Paulo (SP)

Average order contains 1-2 items
